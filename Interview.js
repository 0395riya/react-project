// 1.  What is React?
// answer - React is an open source javascript library.
// React is used for building user interfaces (UI)
// React is simplifies the creation of Single Page Application by using reusable components. 

// 2. What is Single Page Application ?
// On web page if many component updated or new component added the page will never reload or refreshed and only the same page updated everytime. 
// --A SPA is a web application that have only one single web page.
// Whenever user do some action on website, then in response content is dynamically updated without refreshing or loading a new page. 

// 3. What are the advantages of React ?
// Simple to build Single Page Application 
// React is cross platform and open source 
// Lightweight and very fast (virtual DOM)
// React is supported by large community and Ecosystem. 

// Disadvantages ........
// React is not good choice for very small application

// 4. Difference between React and Angular 

// React and Angular both are used to create single page UI applications using components.  
// React is a javascript library                    Angular is a complete framework. 
// React uses virtual DOM which makes it faster.    Angular uses a real DOM 
// React is smaller in size and lightweight and      Angular is bigger because it is a complete framework.
// therefore faster sometime. 
// React depends on external libraries for many       Angular is a complete framework , therefore it provide built-in-support for features like routing , forms, validation, and HTTP Requests. 
// complex features

// 5. What is DOM ? (Document Object Model)
// DOM represents the web page as a tree like structure  which allow Javascript to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of a web page. 

// 6. Difference between DOM and virtual DOM 
// React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI without re-render the entire page , which helps improve performance and make the application more responsive. 

// 7. What are data types in JS? What are primitive data types? 
// Primitive data types are immutable, which means their values cannot be changed or modified if they are created. They can hold only single value.

// 8. Difference between Primitive and Non-Primitive data types ? 
// Primitive- 1. Number, string, boolean, null, undefined are primitive data types 
//            2.It hold only single value 



// Non-Primitive- 1. Object, array, function, date, RegExp are non-primitive data types 
//                2. It hold multiple values and methods


/////// Hooks ////////////
// Hooks were added to react in version 16.8
// Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other react features. Because of this , class components are generally on needed.


///// Higher Order component /////
// higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

//// Pure Component
//// React pure components are the components that do not re-render when the value of props and state has been updated with the same values. Since these components do not cause re-rendering when the same values are passed thus they improve performance.


///Q. 1 What are the new tags in HTML5 ?
//// Like article, details, audio, figure, footer, header, canvas, command
// New types of <input> tag - color, date, datetime-local, datetime, email, month, number, range, search

///Q. 2 Should we inject div inside a span tag? Will HTML give error?
// In HTML, it is generally not considered proper or semantic to place a block-level element like <div> inside an inline-level element like <span>. The <div> element is used for creating block-level containers that typically represent larger sections of content, while the <span> element is used for applying styles or inline-level formatting to specific portions of text.

///Q. 3 What is event delegation and event bubbling?

///How different is Reactâ€™s ES6 syntax when compared to ES5?

//1.  require vs import  
//ES5   var React = require('react');
//ES6   import React from 'react'

// 2. export vs exports
// ES5    module.exports = Component;
// ES6    export default Component;
