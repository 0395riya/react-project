The call center trainer is the one who is responsible for the skill development of associates. Apart from skill development, a trainer is responsible for several other tasks which I will discuss further in this article.\nOur today’s topic is on “Roles and Responsibilities of Trainer the Call Center”      \n\n\n\n\nRoles and Responsibilities of  Trainer in the Call Center\n\n\n\nRoles and Responsibilities of Trainer the Call Center\n\nBefore understanding the roles of a trainer in the call center lets first understand\n\nWhat is the definition of a Trainer?\n\nA Call Center trainer is the one who train, coach, and develop skills amongst the new joining associates to improve their product knowledge, performance and to achieve higher customer satisfaction.\n\nIn Call Center after HR (Human Resource), a trainer is the first individual in the organization who meets with the new joiners and welcome them on board.\n\nIt is rightly said that before training the employees a trainer should be proficient in communication and development skills.\n\nNow I will talk about the “Roles and Responsibilities of Trainer the Call Center\n\nAlso Read: Tips to control shrinkage in the Call Center \n\nAlthough being into the training department a trainer is assigned with different tasks but here I will discuss 5 Major roles of Trainer in the call center which plays a very significant role to grow any organization\n\n1. Coaching and Mentoring: Coaching and Mentoring of agents is the primary key role of a trainer. These 2 terms are sound equivalent but different in meaning. Coaching is a term used for a shorter period in which a trainer coach associates for a specified time on product knowledge and performance grounds.\n\nWhile on the other hand Mentoring can be assumed as a continuous process that is more focused on developing skills. Mentoring is about making the associates learn about new skills by sharing your experience and knowledge.\n\n2. The session for Poor Performers One of the major roles assigned to the trainer is to work on poor or BQ (Bottom Quartile) agents.On the production floor when the agents are lacking in terms of product knowledge and creating blunder with the call quality that time a trainer must conduct the session of those agents.\n\nIf these agents are not taken care of at the right time it can lead to customer and client dissatisfaction and can adversely impact the entire process. Not in terms of call quality but also a trainer must work upon the communication skills of these agents in a frequent period.\n\nRead:Roster Planning in Call center \n\n\n3. Refresher Session: A trainer must provide refresher sessions to its old employees in a specific period. Though there is no specific time of refresher training you should make sure that agents are up to date about the latest product knowledge.\n\nIn the call center industry especially in the inbound process, the products and process flow chart keeps on updating time to time, hence this becomes the core responsibility of a trainer to cascade these recent product updates to the agents on priority to avoid any escalation from client's end.\n\n\n\nProduct Knowledge Test\n\n4. Conducting test: One of the core responsibilities of a call center trainer is to conduct regular tests regarding the recently shared process updates. This test is known as the PKT (Product Knowledge Test). Product knowledge tests are conducted to gauge the agent’s product knowledge.\nAlso conducting these tests on regular intervals can help you to identify the agents who are lacking in product knowledge and also agents who are not attentive during the refresher and training sessions. This way you can make the plan of action to these outliers","min_salary":"0","max_salary":"0 - 0","total_vacancy":"5","industry":"Education","min_exp":"1","max_exp":"1","role":""},{"title":"Hr Executive","location":"delhi, India, Post Date: 20 Dec,2021Last Date to Apply: 20 Apr,2022","company":"Smartmovess consulting zone","skills":"RECRUITER , RECRUITMENT","job_discription":"Job brief\nWe are looking for an HR Recruiter to manage our full cycle recruitment, from identifying potential hires to interviewing and evaluating candidates.\nHR Recruiter responsibilities include sourcing candidates online, updating job ads and conducting background checks.
